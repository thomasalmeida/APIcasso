    # When your application needs some kind of custom interaction that is not covered by
    # APIcasso's CRUD approach, you can make your own actions using our base classes and
    # objects to go straight into your logic. If you have built the APIcasso's engine into
    # a route it is important that your custom action takes precedence over the gem's ones.
    # Usage:
    # match ' /: resource /: id / custom-action ' => ' custom # not_a_crud ' , via  :: get 
    # mount Apicasso :: Engine , em:  " / api / v1 "
